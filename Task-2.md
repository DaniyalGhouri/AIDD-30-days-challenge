# Part-1
# 1. Nine Pillars Understanding
# Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

this is better for us because we don't have to think about coding , syntax, file management ,it makes us more productive and strategic to think more complex system architecture development agents are writing code by using markdown language as a new programming language.

# Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer.

the nine pilliars of AIDD help us to grow into M-shaped developer because it doesnt restrict or expert us in single domain but multiple expertise or peak production level mastery, in nine pillars of AIDD we examine frontend , backend, design and integration of ML/AI in our projects.

# 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
# Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

vibe coding usually create problem after one week because we only use code for production without testing or architecture like what to do and how to do , we don't have a particular path to execute a project we just following LLM what it gives and if it works then this is our architecture and this is our flow and if we had to add additional features its a complete mess we probably have to change the whole code or functionality of our project for adding one more feature.

# How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

the SSD prevent this problem by making system architecture or Specification of project feature, requirement, what it should deliver or what will be the success of our project before start coding then test the feature how to execute if it works then we ll add this in our code. 

# 3. Architecture Thinking
# How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

yes it changes the role of a developer old role of a developer was to code , solving errors, debugging, implement features but today because of AIDD the role of developer is to design the work flow how data will be flow and how will it manage , what will be the risk in system-architecture-failure etc. these are the new roles of developers

# Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

because raw code only focuses on errors or probably a single feature the layers concept shows us that if we make layers in our project and if something vrashes we know where the issue we wont find the issue in the whole code or change everything like if we make layers of different features of filtering , searching ,sorting and if the issue is in sorting we'll only focus on sorting section not all the features.


# Part-2
# CLI Prompt
generate a 1-paragraph for email validation function which must contain "@", valid domain like (.com, .org) and clear error message.
# Paragraph generated by CLI
This email validation function ensures that a given string adheres to standard email formatting requirements. It verifies the presence of a single "@" symbol, separating the local part from the domain, and confirms that the domain includes a valid top-level domain such as ".com" or ".org". Should the input fail to meet these criteria, the function returns a clear and specific error message indicating the nature of the invalidity, guiding the user to correct their input. 

# Part-3
# Multiple choice question

1. What is the main purpose of Spec-Driven Development?

B. Clear requirements before coding begins


2. What is the biggest mindset shift in AI-Driven Development?

B. Thinking in systems and clear instructions


3. Biggest failure of Vibe Coding?

B. Architecture becomes hard to extend


4. Main advantage of using AI CLI agents (like Gemini CLI)?

B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving


5. What defines an M-Shaped Developer?

C. Deep skills in multiple related domains
