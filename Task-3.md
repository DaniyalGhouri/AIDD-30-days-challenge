# Part A
# 1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
New improvements In Gemini 3.0 are different models like deep think and pro, deepthink model designed for complex multi step reasoning better for maths , coding and scientific problem which require more consideration and longer thinking before generating a response, while pro model is standard flagship model but its faster than before.
it enhanced to agent capabilities rather than just a chat bot like organizing email, task , plan a schedule, also the Antigravity model which is new agentic developemnt platform for IDE which allow users to generate code run test on gemini 3. also it introduce "Bash Tools" for vibe coders to perform command line operation for file handling and task during development.
it also include "Day One" Search integration which uses a new technique called "Query Fan-out" where the model breaks complex user's queries into sub-queries to search deeper for accurate info from web simultaneously.

# 2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
It improves coding by adapting Agent rather than ai Chatbot which can plan, execute and act accordingly some features are:
Vibe coding : where gemini 3.0 build a softwares rather than giving instruction
Antigravity (IDE): An Agentic Integrated development Environment it will have direct access for code editor, terminal and browser.
bash tools:  interact directly with computer for file handling create or manage files by using terminal
Deep think:before writing a code it simply think the architecture the issue and then write code

# 3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
it claims for worlds best multimodal for understanding native video, audio and image inputs i cannot only recognize image but also can elaborate deep reasoning across modalities simultaneously.
simultaneous lsten, watch and read , long context video understanding.

# 4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
Google AntiGravity: An Agentic IDE for gemini 3.0 to act as autonomous coding partner which has access to terminal , code editor and browser, run terminal command and write project files.
Bash Tools:It gives Gemini 3.0 the ability to issue and execute standard Linux/Unix command-line instructions. This allows the model to navigate file systems, install dependencies,different modalities simultaneously.
